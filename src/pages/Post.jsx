          <strong>Safety Tips:</strong> We want everyone to have a safe and
          positive experience, so here are some tips: Meet in a safe, public
          place, like a caf√©, mall entrance, or a busy open area. <br />
          <br /> Avoid sharing sensitive personal information (e.g., phone
          number, bank details). Don‚Äôt include your full home address in your
          listing. Only share your general location or landmark. <br />
          <br /> Report anything suspicious or offensive by clicking the{" "}
          <strong>‚ÄúContact‚Äù</strong> link at the bottom of the page. Trust your
          gut. If something feels off, don‚Äôt proceed. Let‚Äôs keep this community
          kind, respectful, and safe for everyone. ü§ù
